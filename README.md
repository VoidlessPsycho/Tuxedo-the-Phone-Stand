# Tuxedo the Phone Stand
Hello, my name is Voidless, and this is my phone stand with a spot for a lightning cable and iPhone 14.

I made this project as part of the Blueprint YSWS for the Hack Club organization. I wanted to make a phone stand as my phone is usually randomly placed on my nightstand, and it often falls off. I used the Onshape platform to 3D Model the phone stand.
